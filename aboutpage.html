                    Satoshi Tajiri (Japanese: 田尻 智, Hepburn: Tajiri Satoshi, born August 28, 1965) is a Japanese video game designer 
                    and director who is the creator of the Pokémon franchise and the co-founder and president of video game developer Game Freak.

                    A fan of arcade games in his youth, Tajiri wrote for and edited his own video gaming fanzine Game Freak with Ken Sugimori, 
                    before evolving it into a development company of the same name. Tajiri claims that the joining of two Game Boys via a link 
                    cable inspired him to create a game which embodied the collection and companionship of his childhood hobby, insect collecting. 
                    The game, which became Pokémon Red and Pokémon Green, took six years to complete and went on to spark a multibillion-dollar 
                    franchise which reinvigorated Nintendo's handheld gaming scene.

                    Tajiri continued to work as director for the Pokémon series until the development of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, 
                    when he changed his role to executive producer, which he holds to this day.
